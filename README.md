- This application contains the Public Chat room feature which will enable only for the authenticated user.

- Implementation of Arithmetic Captcha on Sign Up Page.

- It is developed using docker, redis layer, Django channels and websockets

- In this application, the user can edit their details, the authenticated user can see the list of all users

- Multiple users can chat at the same time.

- Please run docker command - 'docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:5' before running this application.
